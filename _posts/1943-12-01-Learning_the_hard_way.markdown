I learned about the Army the first day I was in. We arrived in Salt Lake City by train from Newark, N.J. after dark and had only a sandwich on the train at about 3pm. The mess hall was closed and they decided to keep us busy until lights out at 10pm, getting bedding and then clothes, which took quite a while. I was pretty hungry so I talked to the guy in the cot next to mine and we got up early the next morning, and were first in line outside the tents, next to the mess hall. After roll call, the sergeant said “Right face, forward march. Into the mess hall. You first two guys hold those doors open ‘till everybody’s in.” By the time we got in there wasn’t too much left to eat.

We were assigned to a crew in Salt Lake City, but I first got to talk to Bob Goesling and Bud Abbott on the train from Salt Lake to Rapid City, SD, where we were supposed to be for two months operational training along with many other crews. At that time the navigator was a guy named Anderson but after we got to Rapid City we were assigned Buster Garhart as Navigator.

This was early December and I can only remember one training flight at Rapid City, during which I set up the bombsight and autopilot and we made some practice runs without bombs and also got some practice with the pilot following the PDI[1]. I remember thinking how slowly the B17 turned when turning the knobs on the bomb sight to maneuver around. Anyway, it snowed some more. After a while the snow piled up to the second story windows of the Army barracks and it was definitely proven that the snow plows couldn’t keep up with it, it was suddenly announced that a train would be leaving for MacDill Field, Tampa, FL, after everybody got brought up to date on all their shots. After getting jabbed in the arms with four shots I was sort of delirious. I had a fever so bad that I opened the window in our room on the second floor and the snow fell in! I still felt very light headed the next morning when they called everybody out to formation. It was announced that everybody and all their gear would be going to Florida on a train the next day except for those who had a car at Rapid City.

"Would everyone who has a car here step forward, and you will be put on a list and allowed travel time to take you cars home, but are not to take your cars to MacDill". I and a whole bunch of others stepped forward. The Major in charge said there weren’t that many cars in Rapid City, please get back in line. Well, I was just light headed enough from the shots to be a little slow and as about 80% of those who had stepped forward now stepped back in line, I stayed put. Soon enough I got on the list, and received leave and travel papers for the trip home and then to MacDill. 

I took a train to Chicago and then home and spent 5 or 6 days at home and then took a train to Tampa. They hadn’t missed me, or at least were disorganized enough not to know what to do about it. My flight bag was lying alongside the railroad tracks where it had been thrown.
