Buster Garhart, our navigator, was a big guy - maybe 6’-1” or 6’-2” and a football player. He was a math major from everybody’s favorite college - Slippery Rock Teachers College in Pennsylvania, where he had worked in the steel mills. Strong as an ox, he was fun loving and not afraid of anything or anybody, especially on a dare.

When we were in Savannah and it became evident we weren’t going to fly overseas we got the weekend off. I don’t remember who else from the crew was with Garhart and I, but there were two of three others. Whenever we were out for a night on the town it became a favorite pastime to load up Buster’s drinks. As he was the biggest he was sure he could hold his liquor better and drink anybody else under the table. Every time he tuned his head or left the table somebody (?) or everybody poured more bourbon into his bourbon and coke. So if he thought he had four or five drinks along with everybody else he actually had maybe ten or twelve.

As the night wore on Garhart became increasingly higher than a kite and ready for anything. Along about two o’clock when most of Savannah had taken in its sidewalks, Buster was running down the main street and wondering rather loudly (at the top of his voice) “Where are all the girls in this town?” The rest of us decided it was time to get some coffee in Buster before he got arrested. Spying a lighted sign for a diner we grabbed and pushed Buster toward it. As he stepped up the four little steps to the door, the door opened and out stepped a girl in a bright red dress.

Well, this could accurately be described as waving a red flag at a raging bull. Buster grabbed the girl and whirled her around, with his back to the diner door, which as you might expect was being held by a guy in an Air Corps uniform. A 2nd Lt, a navigator, well ____ or not, he let go of the door, cocked his right fist and grabbed Buster’s shoulder with his left hand and turned him around to get a shot at his jaw. This guy and Garhart looked at each other, Buster cried “Buddy!”, and Buddy cried “Buster!”. They hugged each other in delight. This guy was a bosom buddy of Busters from navigation school. They were both so delighted to see each other they danced around and went back into the diner, leaving the poor girl standing bewildered all alone on the steps of the diner. Who walked off with the girl in the red dress at two in the morning in Savannah, GA, I’ll never tell.
