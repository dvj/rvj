In case anybody ever reads this, they should remember it was written 46 years after the events. In 1989 I read of a reunion of the 483rd bomb group and write to Harry Whye who had put the notice in the V.F.W Magazine. I joined the group association and was put in touch with the other members of my crew. At the present time I intend to attend the 1990 reunion in Buffalo. All of this brought back a lot of memories and I started to put them down, having the photographs given to me when I finished my missions to remind me of some things.

This is all just my own personal thoughts except for the copies of orders. It may be that it wasn’t all as I remember as I’m sure I’ve forgotten a lot and embellished a lot more.
